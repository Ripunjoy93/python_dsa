# Problem solving strategies: Best practices

## Seven step problem solving:

1. Listen carefully to the problem, listen for clues.
2. Draw an example: large and generic.
3. Brute force. It can be slow. State the complexity & optimize.
4. Optimize. Often we can optimize before writing code itself.
5. Walk through the algorithm before writing.
6. Write code. Write real code not pseudo.
7. Verification. Can be manual. Check test cases manually. Check complexity. Code review.

## Another systematic strategy:

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

## Optimizing with BUD:

1. Bottlenecks
2. Unnecessary Works
3. Duplicate work

## Optimize with space and time:

1. Hash-tables
2. Pre-computation
3. Tries
4. Best conceivable runtime (BCR): given the nature of the problem, what is the best runtime we could possibly imagine getting? What runtime we could clearly not bear. BCR not necessarily achievable but it's just not beatable.

## Optimizing with DIY: Do It Yourself

1. Come up with a good example (large & generic), then figure out the output.
2. Reverse Engineer the intuitive thought process.
3. Pay attention to any short circuiting or tricks we use.
